Assignments for the guided course C Programming For Beginners - Master the C Language

This is my portfolio of works that were produced as part of undergoing a beginner remote learning course for the C Programming language.

The course was studied on Udemy and is found here:

As the assignments were reasonably open-ended, students were able to produce different answers to each other and the instructors.
As a result, I have been able to produce original solutions in order to solve the original problems.

With the topics covered, the solutions should be able to demonstrate reasonable technical competence with basic and some intermediate C skills.
